Ignore Summerhangman.py, I really wanted it to work but I couldn't fix it in time :(. My offical project submission is rps.py


Disc: This code is for people who get super bored over the summer and need something to do. The program is a simple game of rock paper scissors where the computer randomly choose between rock paper and scissors.


List/Data Collection Ex:
```
RPS = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
```

Loop Ex:
```
while userInput.lower() not in RPS:
  userInput=input("I'm sorry but thats not a valid input! Pick rock, paper or scissors!")
  userInput = userInput.lower()
```

Function Ex:

```
def compChoice():
  return random.choice(RPS)
```
